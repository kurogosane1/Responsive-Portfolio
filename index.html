			<img id="ME" src="assets/images/Portfolio.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Syed">

			<p>I have a bachelors in Business Administration from University of Houston - Bauer College of Business where I was focused my attention towards Accounting. I always was interested in programing but always assumed that you needed to have a Bachelors degree and needed to be a mad scientist in math to program. </p>

			<p>As I got into different roles in Accounting I started noticing a trend where computer programs in the cloud were replacing the traditional installed operating programs. I moved to an oil and gas company where I was surprised to discover that the <strong> Accountants </strong> where at times required to create a Macro using excel. I never heard of Macro's until I saw someone creating a macro in Excel using programming codes. </p>

			<p> It sparked my interest and was tempted to learn programming but wanted help to learn programming. I came across one ad of UT Austin Bootcamp and decided then there itself that I would join the program and here is the result that you see.
